### Files

Files can be uploaded to Lavagna and associated with the current card. When the same file is uploaded to two different cards, a link is created to the existing instance to save space in the database.

File size can be limited in the administration panel, see <<Configuration parameters,Configuration parameters>>.

#### Upload files

To upload one or more files, click on **Select Files** under the **Files** tab. (requires CREATE_FILE permission)

Multiple files can be uploaded at once: a queue is created locally, and the files will be uploaded in sequence.

* <i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> : a file is in the queue
* <i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i> : a file is being uploaded
* <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> : a file wasn't uploaded successfully
* <i class="fa fa-check"></i> : a file was uploaded successfully

At any time, it's possible to remove a file from the queue by clicking <i class="fa fa-times"></i>, or to abort an ongoing upload by clicking <i class="fa fa-stop"></i>.

When a file is uploaded successfully, the file will appear in the file list.

When an upload has failed, due to error or abort, it's possible to requeue the file by clicking <i class="fa fa-repeat"></i>.

#### Delete files

To delete a file, click on <i class="fa fa-trash-o"></i>. A confirmation panel will appear as an additional failsafe. Deleting a file uploaded by the same user does not require any additional permission. (deleting all files requires DELETE_FILE permission).

Once a file is deleted, a particular type of notification will appear in the lower left corner of the application. Clicking undo will result in the file being restored.
