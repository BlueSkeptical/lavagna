### Card

#### View and manage a single card

When a card is open, this view is presented.

The view can be divided in for main areas: header, left column, center column, right column.

#### Card header

The card header contains information about the card location, in the format of <project>/<board>/<shortname> in column> <column>.

The colored band at the top recalls the column status (see <<Manage Columns,Manage Columns>>).

Clicking on the card name will trigger the edit form.

#### Left column

The left column contains the basic card information, such as who created the card, when it was created, when it was last modified and by whom, who is assigned and who is watching the card, when the card will be due to completion, and to which milestone it belongs.

#### Quick action panel

The quick action panel allows to move a card to a different location, without going back to the board view.
