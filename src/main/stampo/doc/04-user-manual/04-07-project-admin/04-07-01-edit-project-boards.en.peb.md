### Project and boards settings

The first tab is the project settings panel. It will be possible to change the name (but not the autogenerated shortname), the description, and archive the project.

The **Preview** button will render the description markdown.

To edit the board, click <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> to toggle the edit panel. The panel works in the same way as the project settings, but <i class="fa fa-times"></i> and **Cancel** close the edit form.

The shortcut <i class="fa fa-archive"></i> archives the board, and <i class="fa fa-upload"></i> will restore it. An archived board has its colors faded.
