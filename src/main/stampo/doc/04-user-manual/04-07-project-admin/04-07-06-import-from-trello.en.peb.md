### How to import your data from Trello


If a Trello API key has ben configured then you can import any board directly into Lavagna.
To configure the Trello API key look at the <a href="{{relativeRootPath}}/03-configuration-and-administration/03-01-config-parameters">Configuration Parameters</a> documentation.
Please note that currently it will import only some part of your boards (columns, cards, comments, checklists, members, due date) and the creator will be the user used for the import.

On connect you'll be asked to authorize Lavagna.

After the authorization you can choose which board you want to import.
By enabling "Import also archived cards" you'll import also the board's archive, be advised that this may severely impact the amount of data processed.

Once you configured what you want to copy the cards are imported in Lavagna.
