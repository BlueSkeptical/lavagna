### Project milestones

The **MILESTONES** tab shows the status of the milestones present in the project.

For each milestone, a percentage and quantity of how many cards are in each status (BACKLOG, OPEN, CLOSED, DEFERRED) are given.

Cards that are not assigned to any milestone will be grouped under the "unassigned" panel.
