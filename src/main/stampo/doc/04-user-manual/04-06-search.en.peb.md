## Search

The search bar at the top is context sensitive. The context are:

 - global search: when the user is in the home page
 - project specific search: when the user is in a project
 - board filter: when the user is in the board view
 
Currently the search only support implicitly the "AND" operator. Each search term are
part of a list of filter that *must* match.


TBD complete.
