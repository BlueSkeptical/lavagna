### Columns

Columns are used to define the current status of a card. This is done by combining two metadata:

* the name of the column
* the status assigned to the column, represented by the color in the header

There are four main statuses:

* OPEN: used for both new and in progress cards, without distinction
* CLOSED
* BACKLOG
* DEFERRED

The aggregate number of cards by status present in the board is then reflected in the main and project dashboard.

#### Change the name of a column

To change the name of a column, click on the name itself to open the edit form. Enter the new name, and then press either update to save the change, or cancel to discard it.

#### Column menu

Each column has its own context menu, reachable from the <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i> icon that appears when the cursor moves on the column header, containing a small set of useful operations:

* Add a card: see add a card
* Status: change the status assigned to the column
* Move all cards to Archive: archive all the cards that belong to the column, but keep the column in the board
* Move all cards to Backlog: move all the cards that belong to the column to the board backlog, but keep the column in the board
* Move all cards to Trash: move all the cards that belong to the column to the board trash bin, but keep the column in the board
* Move column to Archive: archive the column and all its cards. The column won't be available in the board anymore
* Move column to Backlog: move the column and all its cards to the board backlog. The column won't be available in the board anymore
* Move column to Trash: move the column and all its cards to the board trash bin. The column won't be available in the board anymore
