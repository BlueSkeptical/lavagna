### Interact with the board

Cards can be moved around the board by dragging the from their current location, and dropping them where desired. A shadow will appear on a card when it can be dragged.
A card will maintain its position in a column: if it's dropped in the middle, it'll stay in the middle.
By default, a card created with the column context menu will appear at the top, if created with the shortcut on the footer, will be added at the bottom.

The order of the column can be modified too: drag a column by it's header, and place it where desired.
