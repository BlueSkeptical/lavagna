### Card menu

Each card in the board has its own context menu, from which it's possible to execute some basic operations.

To access the card menu, click on the <i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i> that appears when hovering on a card.

A modal menu will open, keeping the card in focus, and displaying the various options. To close the menu, click on <i class="fa fa-times"></i>.

The operations available on the card menu are:

* **Move card to column**: it will open a secondary menu, where it is possible to chose one of the available column, and move the card there. To return to the initial menu, click **Cancel**.
* **Move to Archive**: archive the card
* **Move to Backlog**: move the card to the board backlog
* **Move to Trash**: move the card to the board trash bin
* **Watch/Unwatch** subscribe or unsubscribe the current your to the card notifications
* **Take/Surrender** the card is assigned to the current user, or removed from his tasks list

If the status of a card changes while the menu is open, the menu will close automatically to enforce consistency.
