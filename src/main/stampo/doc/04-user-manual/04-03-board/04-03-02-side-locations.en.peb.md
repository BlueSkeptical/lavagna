### Archive, Backlog, and Trash

Each board has some special columns where cards that are not relevant anymore to the current project can be moved to declutter the view.

* **ARCHIVE** old and unused cards can be moved here
* **BACKLOG** cards that won't be relevant for a while can be stored here
* **TRASH** cards that aren't useful at all can be "deleted" by moving them here

When a card is moved to one of the special columns, it won't count anymore towards the project and board statistics, but it'll still count towards the milestone status.

To open the special columns, click on the <i class="fa fa-folder-o"></i> icon in the navigation bar.

An additional, special column will slide in from the left. To switch between Archive, Backlog, and Deferred click on <i class="fa fa-cared-down"></i> near the special column name.

Cards in the special columns are paginated, and can be accessed as normal cards. The order the cards are displayed in the special columns is not editable like in the normal columns.

Cards can be dropped in a special column, and can be dragged from it.
