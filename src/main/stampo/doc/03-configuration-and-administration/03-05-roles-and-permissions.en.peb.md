## Roles and permissions

In this section, you can create new roles, manage the permissions of each role, and assign users to the desired roles.

Each roles contains a list permissions, that enable one or more actions. A user can be assigned to more than one role, and the permissions will be merged.

In addition, each project can have its own customized roles: users can be assigned a very restrictive global roles, and then a more permissive project roles.

Example: a project administrator doesn't have to be able to configure the application's SMTP settings, or access other projects. A global group with only **SEARCH** and **UPDATE_PROFILE** permissions will suffice, while at project level a group will all the permissions enabled will be assigned to him.

Lavagna ships with the global roles out of the box: **ADMIN** and **DEFAULT**. Those two roles cannot be deleted.

This is the we of the **ROLES** tab:

### Roles

A new role can be created using the top right form: just write the role name, and click **ADD**.

To assign a new user to the role, click <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> in the role's footer, select a user, and click **Add**.

<img class="pure-img" src="{{relativeRootPath}}/images/en/c03_roles_add-user.png" alt="Add user">

A role can be deleted if it's not a system role. In that case, a <i class="fa fa-trash"></i> will be available in the role's footer. Click on it, confirm, and the role will be deleted.

If it's required to know to which roles a user it assigned, the top left text field provides a filter. Search for a specific user, and the view will only display the users matching the filter.
