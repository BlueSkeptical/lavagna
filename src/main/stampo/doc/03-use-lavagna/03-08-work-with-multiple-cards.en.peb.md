## Bulk operations

Is it possible to select multiple cards, and perform the same operations on the entire selection.

To open the bulk operations menu, click on <i class="fa fa-square-o"></i> in the navigation bar: after that, each card will have a selection box, and a **Select** button will appear.

The **Select** button can be used to select either all or none of the cards present in the board.

Once at least one card is selected, a **Do** option, containing the various operations, will appear.
