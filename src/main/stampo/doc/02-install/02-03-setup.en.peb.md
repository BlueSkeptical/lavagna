## Setup

### Step 1, Base url or import

After successfully launching the application, go to http://your-lavagna-install/setup .

The following page will be shown:

 - If it's a new install, confirm that the base url is correct and click **Next** 
 - If it's an import, select the exported file and click **Import**. The import process can take a noticeable amount of time.
 
### Step 2, Login provider configuration

Lavagna does **not** store the user credentials by design: an external provider must be chosen. There are 4 possible choice:

 - demo (use for test purpose only)
 - ldap
 - mozilla persona
 - oauth
 
#### Demo provider

The demo provider must **not** be selected in production, as the password **is** the username. It can be useful for a small test round for evaluating the product.

#### Ldap provider

If the users are stored in a ldap directory (Active Directory is supported too), the ldap provider must be configured.

It requires a user that can query the directory (the Manager DN and Manager Password). 

The query is composed by a base (Search base) and the filter (User search filter), where `{0}` is the placeholder for the username.

The configuration can be tested in the "Check ldap configuration" form.

#### Mozilla persona provider

[Mozilla Persona](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Persona) is the simplest external provider available to configure.

The default Audience value is most likely correct.

#### Oauth provider

The application support 4 external oauth providers: bitbucket, github, google, twitter.

Select the oauth provider of the first account and provide the api key and secret. The provided callback url should be the correct one that must be provided.

See the documentation for:

 - [bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/OAuth+on+Bitbucket)
 - [github](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/). Registration page is https://github.com/settings/applications/new
 - [google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer): the "Google+ API" must be enabled
 - [twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/web/sign-in/implementing)


### Step 3 Insert administator

In the third step, the administrator must be defined. Enter the username and click **Next**.

### Step 4 Confirm

Check the validity of the configuration data. Click on **Activate**: the configuration will be saved and the browser will go to the root of the application. Enter the username (and password if required).
