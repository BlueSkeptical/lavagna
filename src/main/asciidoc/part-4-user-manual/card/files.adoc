==== Files

Files can be uploaded to Lavagna and associated with the current card. When the same file is uploaded to two different cards, a link is created to the existing instance to save space in the database.

File size can be limited in the administration panel, see <<Configuration parameters,Configuration parameters>>.

===== Upload files

To upload one or more files, click on **Select Files** under the **Files** tab. (requires CREATE_FILE permission)

Multiple files can be uploaded at once: a queue is created locally, and the files will be uploaded in sequence.

When a file is uploaded successfully, the icon on the entry will change from icon:times[] to icon:floppy-o[]

===== Delete files

To delete a file, click on icon:trash-o[]. A confirmation panel will appear as an additional failsafe. Deleting a file uploaded by the same user does not require any additional permission. (deleting all files requires DELETE_FILE permission).

Once a file is deleted, a particular type of notification will appear in the lower left corner of the application. Clicking undo will result in the file being restored.
