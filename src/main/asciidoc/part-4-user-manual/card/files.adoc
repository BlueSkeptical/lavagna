==== Files

Files can be uploaded to Lavagna and associated with the current card. When the same file is uploaded to two different cards, a link is created to the existing instance to save space in the database.

File size can be limited in the administration panel, see <<Configuration parameters,Configuration parameters>>.

===== Upload files

To upload one or more files, click on **Select Files** under the **Files** tab. (requires CREATE_FILE permission)

Multiple files can be uploaded at once: a queue is created locally, and the files will be uploaded in sequence.

* icon:clock-o[] : a file is in the queue
* icon:arrow-up[] : a file is being uploaded
* icon:warning[] : a file wasn't uploaded successfully
* icon:check[] : a file was uploaded successfully

At any time, it's possible to remove a file from the queue by clicking icon:times[], or to abort an ongoing upload by clicking icon:stop[].

When a file is uploaded successfully, the file will appear in the file list.

When an upload has failed, due to error or abort, it's possible to requeue the file by clicking icon:repeat[].

===== Delete files

To delete a file, click on icon:trash-o[]. A confirmation panel will appear as an additional failsafe. Deleting a file uploaded by the same user does not require any additional permission. (deleting all files requires DELETE_FILE permission).

Once a file is deleted, a particular type of notification will appear in the lower left corner of the application. Clicking undo will result in the file being restored.
