==== Metadata

When a card is open, this view is presented.

The view can be divided in three main areas: left column, center column, right column.

* 
* The center column contains the card description, and the comments, files, and activity feed
* The right column contains the card labels, and zero or more action lists.

===== Left column

The left column contains the basic card information, such as who created the card, when it was created, when it was last modified and by whom, who is assigned and who is watching the card, when the card will be due to completion, and to which milestone it belongs.

====== Dates

In the **Dates** widget, it is possible to configure a date for when the card will be due for completion (configuring the due date requires the UPDATE_CARD permission).

First, click on [fa fa-calendar]## in the widget action bar.

In the widget footer, a date can now be set, and it will appear in the metadata.

Setting a new date will overwrite the previous value, and clicking on the black cross will remove the metadata.

Note that the **Last updated on** field now reflects the time the last change has been made.

====== People

The **People** widget controls who is assigned to a task, and who is watching for notifications.

A user can watch or claim a task for himself, or assign the card to someone else. (assigning a card requires the UPDATE_CARD permission)

Multiple users can be assigned, or be watching, a single card at any time.

A card can be watched/unwatched by clicking on [fa fa-eye]## in the action widget action bar.

The same applies to self assigning/unassigning a card. The operation is triggered with a click on [fa fa-hand-o-up]##.

It is also possible to assign another user to the card. Clicking on the right-most icon, a form where users can be searched and assigned will appear.

====== Milestones

To add a new milestone, click on [fa fa-plus]## in the widget action bar, select a milestone from the dropdown list, and click **Set** (configuring the milestone requires the UPDATE_CARD permission).
