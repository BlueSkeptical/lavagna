==== View and manage a single card

When a card is open, this view is presented.

The view can be divided in for main areas: header, left column, center column, right column.

===== Card header

image::c04_card_metadata_header.png[Card header]

The card header contains information about the card location, in the format of <project>/<board>/<shortname> in column> <column>.

The colored band at the top recalls the column status (see <<Manage Columns,Manage Columns>>).

Clicking on the card name will trigger the edit form. (requires the UPDATE_CARD permission)

===== Left column

The left column contains the basic card information, such as who created the card, when it was created, when it was last modified and by whom, who is assigned and who is watching the card, when the card will be due to completion, and to which milestone it belongs.

====== Quick action panel

The quick action panel allows to move a card to a different location, without going back to the board view. (requires the MOVE_CARD permission)

Setting a new date will overwrite the previous value, and clicking on icon:times[] will remove the metadata.

Note that the **Last updated on** field now reflects the time the last change has been made.

====== People

The **People** widget controls who is assigned to a task, and who is watching for notifications.

A user can watch or claim a task for himself, or assign the card to someone else. (assigning a card requires the UPDATE_CARD permission)

Multiple users can be assigned, or be watching, a single card at any time.

A card can be watched/unwatched by clicking on icon:eye[] in the action widget action bar.

The same applies to self assigning/unassigning a card. The operation is triggered with a click on icon:hand-o-up[].
