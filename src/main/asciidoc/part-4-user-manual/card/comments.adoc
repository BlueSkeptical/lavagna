==== Comments

Comments are useful to discuss an ongoing task. 

===== Add a new comment

To add a new comment, select the **Comments** tab, enter the text in the form, and press **Add**. The new comment will be displayed at the bottom of the list. (requires CREATE_CARD_COMMENT permission)

Similar to the description, comments can be written using markdown syntax, and the result can be verified at any time by clicking **Preview**.

Once the comment is updated, the previous version isn't lost. The application keeps track of how many times a comment has been updated, and who made those updates.
